Or maybe you can go [here](https://khanhf-ng820.github.io/3D-ECA/) (but you can't change the custom variables though).\
**In** ```script.js``` **you can only change these variables as you like: ruleSet, width, boxWidth, totalGens.**\
**Other variables must not be changed as they are crucial to the code.**\
